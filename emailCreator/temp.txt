Dear Coach z321, 
Thank You for reading my email. My name is Arnav Choudhury and I am a senior at Archbishop Mitty highschool in San Jose, CA.  I have applied to your esteemed college/university and am trying to explore my possibilities of running cross country for your school. I completed my junior with a 4.02 GPA and ran varsity for cross country and track in the last four years. During my four years of high school, I have worked hard to excel in both academics and athletics. I have also raced triathlons over the summers throughout my high school years.
Below are some of my personal best in athletics.
Cross Country: 16:10 (5k)
Track: 4:36 (1600m), 10:06 (3200m)
Triathlon: California High School State Champion in 2019, 2nd place in 2018.
Represented USA in Age Group Triathlon World Championship in 2019.
For more details I have attached my resume with this email. In future, if admitted, I would like to be part of cross country and track teams in your esteemed college.
Sincerely,Arnav Choudhury
